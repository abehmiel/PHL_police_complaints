Officer AP next called the complainant at approximately 6 PM and asked her to call him directly and not utilize 911.  He then asked the complainant to go out for dinner; the complainant declined the offer.  Officer AP then made several other comments and suggestions to the complainant that she felt were highly inappropriate.
