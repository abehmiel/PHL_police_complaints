      "The complainant, GF, 24/F, states that Officer AP, conducted himself inappropriately.  According to the complainant, she called 911 to report an assault; Officer AP responded.  At approximately 3:30 PM, she received a text from Officer AP requesting that she call him; he was just checking to see if she was okay.  The complainant called him at approximately 4 PM and left a message on his voicemail saying that she was safe.  She then received another text message from Officer AP stating that he needed to call back and ask her something.  Officer AP next called the complainant at approximately 6 PM and asked her to call him directly and not utilize 911.  He then asked the complainant to go out for dinner; the complainant declined the offer.  Officer AP then made several other comments and suggestions to the complainant that she felt were highly inappropriate.  The complainant ended up blocking the officer's number; she states that during their conversations, Officer AP did not speak of any matters connected with the police report.    \n"
